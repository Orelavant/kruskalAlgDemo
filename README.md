# kruskalAlgDemo
A web application coded in C# that allows users to draw interconnected lines and better visualize how Kruskal's algorithm finds a minimum spanning tree.

Instructions:
- Click anywhere to create a node.
- Click again to create another node, which will then automatically create a line to the previous node.
- Click on any prexisting node to begin creating a line from that node.
- Once you have a graph, hit the spacebar to see the minimum spanning tree in red.
